This folder contains some sample neuron traces. These can be used to search against the classifier built for the fruitless clone library.

Traces
======
traces/Jai
----------
contains sample traces from the supplemental information of [yu2010]. Some traces were transformed from the T1 template space of [yu2010] into the IS2 template space of [yu2010] and then converted into the standard SWC format.  Each trace corresponds to a particular cell cluster identified by [yu2010], with tracing starting at the cell body.

Example
=======
See `src/score_trace_wrapper.m` matlab script for detailed example. You should be able to do:

help score_trace_wrapper

in the matlab command line. This in turn depends on matlab function score_trace.m. Input files should be swc trace files or whitespace separated xyz coords.
